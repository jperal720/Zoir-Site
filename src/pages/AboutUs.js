        Zoir is such a pretty boy, his lustrous eyeleshes wrap you in close to
        their arms like Van Gohg’s, one and only Starry Night does when you
        first gaze upon it in that one museum, that I want to say is the Louvre
        in Paris, but I’m not too sure at this very moment, where the costs are
        incredibly high and as a proletariat he has not had the pleasure of
        visiting; he does not have that kind of money, and neither do I, the
        writer.

        P.S: I have just figured out that the museum in which Starry Night is
        hung on is called “The Museum of Modern Art”, in Manhattan, New York.
        <br />
        <br />
        P.P.S: Do not criticize this wonderful piece of art, that I so proudly
        call: my writing. It is simply being used to fill the void of this
        website page.
